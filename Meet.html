        <h1 class="heading_meet">Animal Under Protection</h1>
        <p class="paragraph_meet">We had searched all over the east coast of Australia to find a suitable location and property to help animals in need. After an 18 month search we found that at an 850 acre property near Cobargo on the Far South Coast. The property was perfectly set up to house native and farm animals in need, with stables, penned areas and a lot of outbuildings. Unfortunately, fire destroyed our home 3 days after we moved in – we got out moments before it was completely engulfed in flames. We were forced to relocate again, further north to the Mid South Coast to a smaller 67 acres still suitable to release wildlife. This area has grown with the take down of fences with neighbours, the wildlife now free to roam beyond and into the Mogo State Forest. In 2019, Sayo & Rae split up and Rae has been running Wild 2 Free with the help of volunteers ever since.</p>

        <h2 class="heading_meet">Sponsor an Animal</h1>
        <p class="paragraph_meet">Sponsor a joey and help pay for their milk, supplementary feed, bedding and medical needs. Did you know it costs an average of around $1,500 to raise one healthy joey to release age?<br><br>Most of our joeys are in care for around 10 months before soft-releasing. You will be informed when they’ve moved permanently back into the wild. As a release site, there’s a good chance you’ll see photos of the kangaroos long after they’re no longer in care too!<br><br>You will receive a sponsorship certificate and a monthly email update with photos, written from your joey’s perspective. To keep it affordable, we offer multiple sponsorships for each joey in care. If you are interested in exclusively sponsoring a joey, or would prefer to make a one-off payment of $200 as a sponsorship for yourself or as a gift, please contact us directly.<br><br>Every sponsor is personally acknowledged on the ‘Friends’ page of this website. The majority of new orphans arrive between June – October each year. Our 2019 mob have been soft-released now, you can read about them on our meet the mob page.</p>

            <p class="sponsortext"><b>Clover</b><br><br> NICKNAME: Clover the Plover<br>DOB: 20 December 2015<br>ORPHANED: Found alone<br>FROM: Jervis Bay<br>STATUS: Released 2016<br>FACTS: Mother to Elsie and Clyde (both fire survivors). Clover aborted her 3-month old female joey a week after the fire, unable to provide care to herself and a dependent. Aunty Lily adopted her son Clyde. Elsie was old enough to fall pregnant herself (to Kanku). Clover returned to care in March 2020, to recover from more extensive burns. 3.5 months after the fire, she began hopping again and is now living on the land again.</p>

Still young in this photo, rest assured Brutus has blossumed into a very handsome kangaroo. He even smells delicious! The female kangaroos clearly agree, given Brutus has fathered several joeys of his very own now. He’s second in command to orphan mob-boss Kanku and plays it smart to keep his position.</p>

Koa has now ditched the human foster mum in favour of a loving new roo family. He spends his days with ‘Aunty Lily’ or ‘Aunty Kirri’. He likes to spend his evenings hosting parties for all his friends outside the cabin he was raised from – so long as you don’t mind him standing in the feed bin of course.

            <p class="sponsortext"><b>Kanku</b><br><br>NICKNAME: Kanks, Kanky-Boy<br>DOB: 14 January 2016<br>ORPHANED: Fence Entanglement (mother)<br>FROM: Sanctuary Point<br>STATUS: Released 2017<br>FACTS: The alpha of the mob is Kanku. He’s not the alpha of the land though, there’s a bigger male in the back paddocks who says so. Kanku doesn’t mind, and looks after his motley crew of ex-orphans like they were his own family and many of the younger wild joeys are his children. Kanku survived the fire without injury and protected the survivors fiercely when anyone approached in the days following the disaster. He’s our legend and roo hero.
