        <h1 class="heading_about">What is WILD 2 FREE</h1>
        <p class="paragraph_about">Wild 2 Free was established in late 2016 by co-founders Rae Harvey & Sayo Prentic. We had searched all over the east coast of Australia to find a suitable location and property to help animals in need. After an 18 month search we found that at an 850 acre property near Cobargo on the Far South Coast. The property was perfectly set up to house native and farm animals in need, with stables, penned areas and a lot of outbuildings. Unfortunately, fire destroyed our home 3 days after we moved in – we got out moments before it was completely engulfed in flames. We were forced to relocate again, further north to the Mid South Coast to a smaller 67 acres still suitable to release wildlife. This area has grown with the take down of fences with neighbours, the wildlife now free to roam beyond and into the Mogo State Forest. In 2019, Sayo & Rae split up and Rae has been running Wild 2 Free with the help of volunteers ever since.</p>

        <h3 class="heading_about">Why we found this org</h3>
        <p class="paragraph_about">We care for kangaroos, because we can provide something many other wildlife carers cannot – acreage and a release site. Joeys require a large space to develop their muscles, and ideally a safe bush area as well, and we provide that for them. Eastern Grey Kangaroos are said to be the one of the hardest animals to care for in the world, with an extremely high death rate (around 76% in the wild). In care, death is often due to their stress levels, which can cause all kinds of difficult to diagnose ailments, and why they require vigilant husbandry. Their lives are in our hands, so we take our caring role extremely seriously. Did you know a kangaroo chased by a dog, can potentially die a few days later due to the stress it endured? A kangaroo joey can die within 24-hours of diagnosis with some diseases. So far, we have a high success rate and we are working incredibly hard to keep it that way. Our motto is: “We will accept death in care, we won’t accept death due to poor care”. The high level of care involved in kangaroos, has meant we haven’t had the time or funds, to build facilities to house other animals in need… yet!</p>
        <h4 class="heading_about">How is our programs going</h4>
        <p class="paragraph_about">On NYE 2019, the property was destroyed in the Black Summer Bushfire. The house/kangaroo sanctuary, outbuildings, the car, machinery and every single tree was burnt. Rae and volunteer Karen were rescued on a boat by Rae’s neighbour Simon, an RFS volunteer who had already lost his own property. A damaged cabin and a shipping container full of animal feed survived, providing Simon the basic needs to keep the animals alive, until Rae returned 5 days later. Since Jan 5 2020, Rae has been living in the cabin, providing support and care to the survivors. Thankfully only one fire victim was euthanised by a vet, all other burn victims have since recovered. Now it’s time to rebuild and continue to provide a home for wildlife and other animals in need. Wild 2 Free became a registered charity in April 2017. The current committee members are: Rae Harvey, Leigh Blaikie, Margaret Park, Anita Morgan and Nat Gruin.</p>
